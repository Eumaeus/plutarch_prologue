## Introduction

This is an introduction to the Prologue to Plutarch's collection of essays *On the Excellence of Women*. This is a work originally written in Ancient Greek in the 2nd Century BCE. The version of the text that I worked with was translated by Frank Cole Babbitt, published in 1931.[^babbitt] A transcription of Babbitt's translation was published online as HTML in the early 21st Century by Bill Thayer.[^thayer] I am publishing this digital edition under an open license, with documentation.

## Plutarch

Stuff about Plutarch that you find through research. Full name. Where from? [^ocd] Dates of life.[^ocd_dates] Stuff he did. Other things he wrote. *Parallel Lives* is what he is most famous for. Also wrote other stuff; these are called, collectively, the *Moralia*. Some examples of what essays are in the *Moralia*. His essay *On the Excellence of Women* is is one of the *Moralia*, a collection of stories about heroic, brave, or morally correct deeds by women. Plutarch dedicates this work to a woman, his friend Klea: "Regarding the virtues of women, Clea…" [^bowerstock]

## The Prologue

Nepos' essay on Cimon emphasizes…
Plutarch's account of the Trojan Women describes the refugees from the sack of Troy…
Nepos' essay "On Kings" does not focus on a single commander but on the category of "commanders who were also"…

The Preface suggests that Plutarch expected to meet some skepticism, criticism, or even ridicule. How he introduces the book might be a model for any 21st century writer.

Many Greek men in antiquity disapproved of talking about women at all, let alone studying them as models of excellence. The most famous men of Classical Athens held this view, notably Thucydides, the father of scientific history: "[Thucydides] says that the best woman is she about whom there is the least talk… blame or praise; a good woman’s name and body alike ought to be shut up indoors and never go out."

Plutarch *begins* by bringing this up, getting the most extreme contrary view on the table at once. The first words of the whole work are: "Regarding the excellence of women, Clea, I do not hold the same opinion as Thucydides."

Absolute and direct. Plutarch does not argue with Thucydides. He just moves on, only casting a little shade by saying that another opinion, that of Gorgias of Leontini, "is in better taste."

Gorgias wrote that "not the form but the fame of a woman should be known to many." Gorgias does not want to hide women away and never utter their names, and Plutarch says this is better.

He says that the best way is the Roman practice "which publicly renders to women, as to men, a fitting commemoration after the end of their life".

In the rest of the Preface, Plutarch navigates a path between possible errors or sources of criticism. He cares about Excellence as a generic ideal, but in this book he will focus on the Excellence of Women. He needs to let his readers know that, "No, Bro…", by writing this book he is not saying that men aren't excellent.

He does this by saying that there is something to be learned by looking at excellent men and women in the same place and time, and comparing them. He offers four paired examples:

- Semiramis (an Assyrian queen) and Sesostris (an Egyptian king)
- Tanaquil (a Roman queen) and Servius (a Roman king)
- Porcia (a Roman woman) and Brutus (a Roman man)
- Pelopidas (a Theban general) and Timocleia (a Theban prisoner of war)

Woman, man, woman, man, woman, man, man, woman. This is a balanced list--a man for every woman--but Plutarch tweaks it so that it begins and ends with women.

It begins and ends with diversity, too. First is the queen of a great empire, and last is Timocleia, who was a prisoner of war who killed the Macedonian soldier who raped her.

This diversity gets Plutarch to where he can avoid another error. It is a mistake--the very definition of sexism--to assume that all women are alike, or that all men are alike. It was a mistake in the 1st Century, too. Plutarch points out that the excellence of Achilles was different from that of Ajax, Odysseus's from Nestor's, Cato's from Agesilaus's, Eirene's from Alcestis's, and Cornelia's from Olympias's.

Three pairs of (diverse!) men are followed by two pairs of women; those last two pairs justify his whole project.

Eirene and Alcestis were famous *as wives*. Cornelia and Olympias were famous *as mothers* (and teachers, co-conspirators, advisors) of powerful leaders. Excellence "as a wife" or "as a mother" is is a human excellence unvailable to any man.

Plutarch is saying #WomensLivesMatter, because he knows that #AllLivesMatter, and he knowns that that we will be ignorant excellence in *any* human life unless we understand the lives of excellent women.

Plutarch thinks that womens' lives matter, and he wastes no time arguing with anyone who disagrees. He has a book to write about excellent women from his own Greek world, his adoptive Roman world, and the great empires of Africa and Asia, powerful women and enslaved women, queens and wives and mothers.

I will end by talking about Plutarch's audience. Plutarch addresses this work to Clea. We have solid evidence that this is a real person, Flavia Clea, the priestess of the same temple at Delphi where Plutarch himself served as an attendant (a kind of deacon). She was his friend and essentially his pastor. Furthermore, Plutarch had once taught Clea's mother and was a longtime friend of Clea's father.[^bowerstock] So here is an *old* man writing, with respect and without condescension to a much younger woman, his former student student, daughter of his student, and now his intellectual equal and even his spiritual councellor.

There is another woman present in the Preface. Plutarch says that this book continues a conversation he and Clea had after the funeral of their mutual friend, the Delphic priestess Leontis.

So Plutarch is writing for his friend Clea, and their friend Leontis.

[^bowerstock]: The literary and epigraphic evidence for Flavia Clea, her life and profession, her family, and their relationship with Plutarch is presented in G.W. Bowerstock, “Some Persons in Plutarch's *Moralia*” *The Classical Quarterly* 15.2 (1965) 276–270.

## Short Conclusion

But Madeleine Turnipseed, Furman ’22, has reminded me that Plutarch was really writing for the general public and posterity. So his dedication to Leontis and Clea is not a private affair, but a very public statement, an act of public respect to two women--real women, professional women, intellectual women, Plutarch's friends--by a man who clearly thought that they were excellent and mattered in life and death.
